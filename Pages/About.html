        <p style="color: white;">Hi there! I'm a computer technician with experience in building custom PCs, repairing hardware and software issues, and helping people get the most out of their technology. Whether it's creating a high-performance gaming system, fixing a tricky software problem, or upgrading an existing setup, I take pride in delivering practical and efficient solutions.

            I also sell computers and enjoy working directly with customers to recommend systems that suit their needs. Helping others navigate the world of technology and find exactly what they’re looking for is a big part of what I do.
            
            When I’m not working, I enjoy playing games and exploring the latest tech trends. I’ve also picked up some basic programming skills, which come in handy for troubleshooting and smaller personal projects.</p>
