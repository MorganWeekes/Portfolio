    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        Hi, I’m Morgan — a Computer Hardware & Software Technician and Embedded Systems Designer based in 
        Sandiacre, Nottinghamshire. I specialize in building modular systems that integrate hardware precision 
        with software flexibility, and I focus on solving complex problems with clean, maintainable solutions.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Diagnostics and troubleshooting across embedded platforms, modular builds, and system-level debugging.</li>
        <li>Scripting and automation using batch, Python, and PowerShell to streamline file management and embedded control.</li>
        <li>Interactive system design, including Unity input systems, modular state machines, and non-blocking animation engines.</li>
        <li>Media and metadata organization for large-scale libraries, with an emphasis on franchise completion and sortable naming conventions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How I Work</h2>
    <p>
        I iterate quickly, document clearly, and avoid boilerplate. Every script I write solves a real problem, 
        and every system I build is designed to scale. I value clarity over cleverness, and I treat technical polish 
        as a requirement, not an optional extra.
    </p>

    <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
    <p>
        I’m focused on clean workflows, pixel-perfect design corrections, and portfolio-ready documentation. 
        Whether I’m building a smart-home scanner or curating a media archive, I bring order to chaos and ensure 
        the systems I create remain reliable over time.
